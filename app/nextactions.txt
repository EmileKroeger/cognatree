Next actions on integrating etymwn data
 * -generate some kind of topologically sorted graph-
 * -crop rare languages (a bit aggressively)-
 * find the real language names
 * -refactor the code a bit so it doesn't talk about energy-
 * Make it possible to highlight languages
 * Add colors to language families
 * add "fake" intermediate nodes for middle english and middle French.g

 * in tree: Make hidden words collapsible

Terminology:
 * What I call "cognate group" is "word family" or (maybe) "paradigm"

More general reflections:

I could have two kinds of tree display:
 * Macro, in language families (most important languages only)
 * Micro, inside a language family
 
Other interesting data:
 * compare words with p- and f-


Now let's start attacking some goddamm linguistic rules:

 * Satem-centum: dorsal consonants (that means palatal and velar - k and g)
 
Some directions I could take this:
 * Build trees for various sound groups, not for words (e.g. english "th")
  * tricky: sounds have rules
 * Have a big laundry list of sound changes, with example words
   like this ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_sound_laws
 * IPA table for each language
  * simpler, and doable
  * A reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant
 * Get better data on cognates from wiktionary
  * or etymwn, which I already have and which is derived from Wiktionary
  
  
Done

 * -Have "branch" have two lists of words, "important" and "not important"-
 * -toggle display of "not important"-
 * -Regroup families by "address", using that to build a tree (auto add IE on top)-
 * -Fix colors of some parts-
 * -have sibling branch be color of parent (sibling actually)-
 * -make a big index of words-
 * -Set right left-to-right order in trees-
 * -in word list, group words by "macro families"-
 * -make it a nice aligned table-
 * -use short language codes-
 * -fix ? in header-
 * -fix IE color in tree-
 * -make more rainbowish color-
 * -simplify color handling (fam only?)-
 * -generate a tree data structure for each of those entries (wordfam)-
 * -Make fuller language families for better depths-
 * -Make a simple language tree viewer-
 * -add count of languages with that word to wordlist-
 * -table: align on top-
 * -split proto IE in several tables-
 * -Find a better name for cognate groups-
 * -Allow sorting of language list by number of branches-
 * -Allow toggling of families in table-
